# Travel Ticket Booking System

The Travel Ticket Booking System is a simple Python console application that allows users to book seats for bus or train travel. It handles seat availability, user inputs for seat selection, and confirms the booking, providing a basic yet functional booking experience.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Welcomes users and guides them through the booking process.
- **Flexible Travel Options**: Allows users to choose between bus and train travel.
- **Real-Time Seat Availability**: Displays available seats and updates them upon booking.
- **Booking Confirmation**: Confirms and displays the booked seats to the user.
- **Payment Page Redirection**: Simulates redirection to a payment page after booking.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the script using the command:
